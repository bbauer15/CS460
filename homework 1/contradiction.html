        <h2>Proof by Contradiction</h2>
        <p>Proof by Contradiction is very similar to a direct proof. But, instead we try to prove a proposition false to (hopefully) derive some false statement like <equ>1=0</equ> showing the proposition could never be false and hence it is true.</p>
        <h3>Example:</h3>
        <p>
            Prove that <equ>6n+20m &#8800; 49</equ> for any two integers <equ>n</equ>,<equ>m</equ>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Proving this can be a bit tricky. Testing every two integers is impossible. It could be done by giving a statement about the left side being even and the right being odd; but that proof could be a bit elusive. But, showing that <equ>6n+20m = 49</equ> is impossible is much more straight forward.
        </p>
        <h3>Proof:</h3>
        <p>
            Suppose, by way of contradiction, the <equ>m</equ> and <equ>n</equ> are integers that satisfy <equ>6n+20m=49</equ>. We can factor a 2 out of the left hand side to yield <equ>6n+20m=2*(3n+10m)=49</equ>. We then divide by 2 to have <equ>3n+10m=24.5</equ>. However, <equ>3n+10m</equ> is an integer and 24.5 is not therefore we have derived a false statement. This shows that <equ>6n+20m=49</equ> can never be true and thus <equ>6n+20m &#8800; 49</equ> for all integers.
