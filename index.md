## CS460 Portfolio

A portfolio of software I wrote while taking the senior sequence at Western Oregon University.

### About Me
//TODO make this sound better :p

I am getting a BS in Mathematics and Computer Science at WOU. I love solving puzzles and also finding methods to solve puzzles. This brought me into mathematics and eventually CS as well. When I found this dual-major, I was set on Western and it was well worth it.

Most of my projects I've connected to the other subject and it has resulted it some really cool things. For example when I took graph theory I wrote the graph structure and the several algorithms we used in class into a gui interface; that way I could use actual experimental data instead of hypotheical.

In order to graduate Western a senior project course must be taken. It is required and highly recommended to create a portfilo of all the work done for future reference. I decided to make mine a sort of tutorial so whenever I need to write a webpage I can come here to get started. I am also going to organize the resources I use as well.

([CS 460](http://www.wou.edu/~morses/classes/cs46x/index.html), 461 and 462).
